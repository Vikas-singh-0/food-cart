      <p>
        If there is any food on earth that I can eat forever and will become
        never bored with that, it is Custard. Custard is my favourite food. I
        ate custard for the first time when I was in class six.

      Food is extremely important for our body because we cannot live without it. we
        always have to eat nutritious food. The food must contain natural
        elements that our body must grow properly.
